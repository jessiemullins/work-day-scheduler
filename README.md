# 05 Third-Party APIs: Daily-Agenda

## Description
This application was created to fill a need for a daily task scheduler. If you are viewing the page within the time frame allotted, the hour blocks will be color coded to reflect which blocks are in the past, present, or future. You may then add or edit tasks within each hour block. 

## Usage

Link to deployed Github page:

Type your hourly task into the empty block next to the hour you want to set the task in. Click the blue save button to save the data to local storage-the page can then be refreshed without losing any data.
To clear tasks for a specific hour block, click into the text, delete text, then hit the blue save button again to save an empty block of time.
